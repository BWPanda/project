Project
=======

This is a suite of modules used on BackdropCMS.org to provide listings of
projects such as modules, themes, and layouts. The base module simply
provides the ability to mark certain content types as "projects". Additional
modules then extend this ability, including the following sub-modules:

- Project GitHub: Populate project information from GitHub.
- Project Usage: Maintain historical information on project installs.

Although this module is based upon the [Drupal Project module]
(https://www.drupal.org/project/project), it is much smaller in scope.
This project does not include an issue tracker, maintainer control,
sandbox/full project toggles, or project packages.

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
